# 🏛️ Bitcoin for Organizations

This curriculum has an overall structure which presents multiple facets of how Bitcoin might serve organizational leaders to a depth suitable for senior professionals.

⚠️ We strongly recommend that everyone reads the first module on Risk before any others. The risk-based approach is fundamental to all modules that follow it. The observations in this first module form the perspective from which all the modules are derived.

📊 Beginning in module 4, the curriculum presents considerations that focus on the rise of Bitcoin from an industry vertical perspective, and those that focus on widely used internal organizational functions.

🎯 A one line summary objective for the curriculum would be:  

**“To provide the basis for all organizations to understand why they need to add The Rise of Bitcoin to their Risk Registers.”**
